# WSBIM2243
This github was created for the course WSBIM2243 given by prof. Beno√Æt Macq at UCLouvain university.

# Milestone 1
The purpose of this project is to recreate different types of algorithm as seen in image processing courses and apply them to brain tumor images.
## Preprocessing (S3-S5)
### Data import (S3-S4)
For this project, DICOM files are used. These have to be changed to tiff files to avoid hundreds of images per patient.

### Equalisation (S4-S5)
Equalisation will be the first thing applied in this project. To types of equalisation will be done: 
- The linear equalisation
- Another equalisation as seen in the course LELEC2885

This will in a first time help us get a better view of the images, but could afterwards be used with other segmentation algorithm.

## Segmentation (S5-S9)
### K-means ++ (S5-S6)

### DB-SCAN (S5-S6)

### Watershed algorithm (S6-S7)

### Otsu thresholding method (S7-S8)

### Countour segmentation (S8-S9)
